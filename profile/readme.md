# Hackathon Entry Page

Welcome! Let's go straight to the challenge.

📂 You are given the following **DATA**:

- 🎺 A dataset of musical instruments.
  - The sounds are **partially labeled**: some instruments have a class label, some don't.
  - The labels are **noisy**: they are inconsistent and potentially wrong.
- 🎼 A song without instruments.
  - The song has the notes written in, but its **instruments are muted**.
  - The instrument *labels* appearing in the song are also given. But we don't tell you **which note corresponds to which instrument**.

✅ Here's your list of **TASKS**:

- Label consistently *all* the instruments in the dataset.
- 🏁 Be sure to look up, as we will have an automatically-update live leaderboard!
- Play the "unknown.mod" song.
- The song is famous! What's the title?
- Generate *new* sounds and use them to play the song.

You can address the tasks in any order you prefer.

## Submission

📄 Submit a brief one-page **REPORT** (don't overdo it!) of your best submission **before June 2nd 2024 at 23:59** via email to Prof. Rodolà.

📈 Metrics and **SCORING**:

- 🏷️ You'll get points depending on your labeling accuracy.
- 🎶 You'll get +0.25 points if you play the song at least once.
- 🤩 You'll get +1 point if you guess correctly the song title.
- 🎧 You'll get points depending on how we like your song with new sounds.
